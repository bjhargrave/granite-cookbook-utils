# README for utils
This repo contains utility scripts and tools that are useful for keeping notebooks looking clean and for managing the Granite CI/CD pipeline.

It's kind of a catch all, but we don't want it to get too unwieldy. So try to only add things if there's no other way to do the thing you are trying to do.

For information about contributing to this repo, code of conduct guidelines, etc., see the [community](https://github.com/granite-cookbooks/community) project.
